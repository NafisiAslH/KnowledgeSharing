# Exploiting Out-of-Band XXE in the Wild from P4 to P1 🏆
<br>&nbsp;

### Phase 1 --> Recon 🧐
1. Collected list of IP from shodan<br>
2. Made full port scan with rustscan<br>
3. Came across IP with port 9180use some XML content<br>
4. I decided to test XXE<br>
<br>&nbsp;

### Phase 2 --> Analysis 🧩
1. I tried to retrieve local files, but i got nothing<br>
2. I used XXE payloads and started to compare with the responses differences, but I got nothing again.<br>

### Phase 3 --> SSRF (P4) 🍳
1. I tried to perform an HTTP request to my burp collab.<br>
2. So I tried several payloads until finally one of them worked.<br>
3. Bingoooooo! now I have P4 submission.<br>

### Phase 4 --> Port Scan (P3) 🍟
1. I thought what about escalating it to P3 with a simple port scanning?<br>
2. So I sent a simple request to 9180 and another to  1234 and compare the two responses<br>
3. So I made a simple port scan for top 10000 ports,  and I got some open ports :)<br>

### Phase 5 --> Limited OOB XXE (P2) 🍔
1. I thought it’s time to test Out-of-band XXE (picture)<br>
2. So we need a malicious DTD file that requests local files<br>
3. Our malicious DTD requests /etc/hostname file and send it to my IP on 1337 port<br>
4. And guess what?I  got the result.<br>

### Phase 6 --> final XXE (P1) 🏅
1. I made the OOB XXE exploitation successfully!! But actually, I couldn’t get any file with multiple lines<br>
2. I tried several techniques such as base64, FTP, ... but i failed in all of them.<br>
3. Finally I was able to do this with error messages<br>
